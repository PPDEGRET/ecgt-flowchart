# ECGT Directive Explorer

An interactive flowchart and decision tree for understanding the EU **Empowering Consumers for the Green Transition (ECGT) Directive** - Directive (EU) 2024/825.

## 🌱 What is ECGT?

The ECGT Directive amends two existing EU consumer protection directives to combat greenwashing and improve product durability information:

- **UCPD (2005/29/EC)** - Unfair Commercial Practices Directive: Adds new definitions, misleading action rules, and a blacklist of always-prohibited practices
- **CRD (2011/83/EU)** - Consumer Rights Directive: Adds pre-contract information requirements about durability, reparability, and software updates
